I chose implementing a client supporting a basic set of operations on top of [PEP 503: Simple Repository API][pep-503]
as my first project for the 52 weeks of Go challenge:

* Lists all available project on a compatible endpoint.
* Lists all available files for a project.
* Display download URLs.

The source code is available at [simple-repository-client-go] on my personal Gitea instance.
