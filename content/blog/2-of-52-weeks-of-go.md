This week's project is a helper package [env] for [xbat].
Package [env] provides platform-independent environment variable expansion and 
together with [shlex] can provide platform-independent shell-style command-line parsing.
This collaboration allows [xbat] users to write powerful commands.

The source code is available at [https://git.urieles.co/aeurielesn/env-go][env].
