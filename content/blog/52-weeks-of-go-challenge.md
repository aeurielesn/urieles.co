I recently came across [kkdai]'s [project52]. The idea is to code
a small project every week for one year. Hence, its name 52 weeks of code challenge.
Just as [kkdai]'s, I will be doing the challenge in [Go] as well.

Let's talk about some constraints:

* One project per week.
* About something new and, hopefully, challenging.
* In any programming language â€” However, I will be primarily doing it in [Go].
* It does not need to be a brand-new idea.

So, let's start: [1 of 52 weeks of Go: a simple repository API client][next].

[project52]: https://github.com/kkdai/project52
[go]: https://go.dev/
[next]: {{< ref "1-of-52-weeks-of-go" >}}
